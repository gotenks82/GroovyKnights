# GroovyKnights

This is a simple groovy implementation of the following scenario:

6 Knights fight each other in a battlefield.

At each round, one knight hits the knight next to him, inflicting a random damage of up to 6 points.

When a knight receives 100 points of damage, he dies.

The last knight standing is declared winner.
